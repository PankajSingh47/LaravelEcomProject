This is basic laravel ecomerce project in which all the kind of basic functionalities i have been added here so if you want to run this project so you need to set database manualy or via xampp and run the following commands
first run "composer update"

then run "php artisan migrate"

then run "php artisan key:generate"

now copy .env.example file to .env file

now set the database name in the .env file 

now run the final command "php artisan serve"

now this project is running on the port "http//localhost:8000"

now you can see all the features of this application 

There is a lot of functionalities have been added in this app like a user can see items and they can add items in the cart and they can get order now and they can see what items they have been purchased here but first of all they need to signup and then they have to signin.

In this project i have put data of items in database with the seeding so if you want to add more items in the product table so you need to do seeding here if you want so you can simply make an admin panel to make an user interface for admin to make intraction with this app

And finally it is just a very basic ecomerce application but all code are free so if you want to add more functions here so you are completely free to make clone or reuse this code

Thank You
